# Calpals üêª
## Welcome to Calpals! This was a project for the UC Berkeley elective ("Decal") course [Cubstart](https://www.cubstart.com/) but also a passion project of helping Berkeley students connect with one another, with the ultimate goal of supporting the U.S. Postal Services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic by encouraging real "snail-mail" letter exchanges and a stamp store within the website. 

It's meant to be a social media-esque website where users (students) could sign up, post their thoughts, see others' posts about common interests and hobbies, and eventually move to letter-writing in order to build connections that could last through the social isolation everyone was feeling.

Some features we would've loved to additionally implement included tags for certain interests (for example: "k-pop", "League of Legends", or "rock climbing") that users could display on their profile, a matching feature based on users' common interests, and building our own chatrooms and direct messages!
